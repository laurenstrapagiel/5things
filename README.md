# Project Title

5 Things

## Overview

5 Things is an anti-anxiety tools that walks users through a common anti-anxiety exercise that asks them to stop and name:
- 5 things they can see
- 4 things they can touch
- 3 things they can hear
- 2 things they can smell
- 1 thing they can taste

### Problem

Although this anti-anxiety exercise is very useful, if you're feeling very anxious it can be hard to slow your thoughts to do this practice. By entering each step of the exercise into the app, users can be more mindful. It's also difficult to track the exerise's effectiveness over time, but by saving data, users can track progress over time and draw connections between events and anxiety.

### User Profile

This app will be for anyone who struggles with anxious thoughts, whether mild or more severe. Though this app is not a treatment for anxiety, the exercise is useful for everyone.

### Features

- users can create an account to be able to keep a record of all their exercise instances
